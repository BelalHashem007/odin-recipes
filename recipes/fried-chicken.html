        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p class="descrip-content">At its core, fried chicken is a simple yet delicious dish consisting of chicken pieces that are coated in a seasoned flour mixture and then deep-fried until golden brown and crispy. The result is tender, juicy chicken with a satisfyingly crunchy exterior. While the basic recipe may seem straightforward, the magic of fried chicken lies in the details.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="ingreds-content">
